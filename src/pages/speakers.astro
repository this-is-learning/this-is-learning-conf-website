            <p>
                Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
                experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
                expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
                size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.
                We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
                Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
                including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.
                Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
                expelled from the conference <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion
                of the conference organizers.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
                identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
                appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices,

                following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
                talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
                sexual attention.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
                immediately.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
                sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.
                Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
                clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers
                may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender
                or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
                have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff
                immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they&#39;ll be wearing
                branded t-shirts.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
                security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
                those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
                conference. We value your attendance.
